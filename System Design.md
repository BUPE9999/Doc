Process
-------------------
Need to have 2 players to play this game
Each player throw 1-3 coins per round.
Need to record the number of coins left and the number of rounds.
The player who threw in the 10th coins firstly win.

Rules
-----------
There are 10 coins all facing heads in beginning. Players take turns. In a turn, a player can flip
either 1, 2 or 3 coins. But the last coin chosen must be facing head. The player who
successfully reached a state in its turn where all 10 coins are tails. That player wins.

The games must be implemented in a console version in a professional way. That is focus on
every dark corner and also implementation must be readable, if the code is hard to read, it is
not good solution, points will be cut for that. So, it is important that not only program works
but implementation is easy to read as well. It must provide rules by default when the program is executed.
It must be user-friendly, meaning when displaying game in console, game state must be clearly
visible. If game state is not clear, or the rules provided are not clear it is considered to be invalid project.
If I give irrelevant inputs, the program must explicitly provide descriptive message stating how
inputs must and be and, in some cases, also stating what was wrong with my input.

Requirement
--------
1. If user want to quit game, how can user do so.
2. If players want to restart the game.
3. If player wants to see the rules in the middle of the game (there must be a way how a player can look up the rules and after displaying rules game must resume).
